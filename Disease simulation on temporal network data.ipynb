    "\n",
    "This simulation was originally made to examine the outcomes of disease outbreaks under various different conditions regarding the type and severity of people's behavior change in responses to the symptoms of an infectious disease. However, by choosing the parameter values appropriately, the simulation can also be used to test situations where there is no behavioral reaction. The code described in this notebook is can also be found in the same repository, temporal_simulation.py is the main simulation code and example.py is is a working example of how to implement it (the same example shown here).

    "\n",
    "Lets choose a dataset and read it in. The data sets are 'conference', 'hospital', 'looped_primary_school', and 'synthetic_temporal_data', all taken from sociopatterns.org. In these studies, participants wore radiofrequency identification (RFID) sensors that detect face-to-face proximity of other participants within $1-1.5$ meters in $20$-second intervals. Each data-set lists the identities of the people in contact, as well as the $20$-second interval of detection. These data have been formatted to appear in a table with the start and end times of the interaction listed instead. To exclude contacts detected while participants momentarily walked past one another, only contacts that are detected in at least two consecutive intervals are considered interactions. \n",
    "\n",
    "The three data-sets used were: (a) a conference in which $110$ participants were recorded over $3$ days, (b) a hospital ward in which $74$ participants were recorded over $4$ days, and (c) a primary school in which $242$ participants were recorded over $2$ days. We looped this data to produce a dataset spanning six weeks. We used the first day to represent Monday, Wednesday and Friday and the second day to represent Tuesday and Thursday. We then added 2 days of inactivity to replicate a typical school week and weekend."

In the simulation, the latent duration for each infected individual is drawn from a log-Normal distribution with mode $\\hat{\\Delta}_{E}$ and dispersion factor $\\sigma_{g}^{(E)}$ (the geometric standard deviation of the distribution). We use $\\sigma=\\sigma_{g}^{(E)}$ and $\\mu= \\sigma^{2}+\\log(\\hat{\\Delta}_{E})$ to get the standard parameters for the log-Normal distribution.\n",

In the simulation, the duration of the infectious period of each individual is randomly selected from a gamma distribution with a mode of $\\hat{\\Delta}_{I}$ hours. We define perseverance as $1/k_{I}$ where $k_{I}$ is the shape parameter of the gamma distribution. By choosing the scale parameter of the Gamma distribution to be $\\theta=\\hat{\\Delta}_{I}/(k_{I}-1)$ we ensure that the mode does not change while increasing the perseverance fattens the the tail of the distribution.\n",
